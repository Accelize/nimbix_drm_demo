# Accelize Distribution Platform
## Accelize HelloWorld FPGA
---
This demo is intended to demonstrate the FPGA design protection and metering capability provided by the Accelize Distribution Platform.

The FPGA Design contains:
- The Accelize DRM IP
- A user IP embedding Accelize Activator IP 
The user ip reports its activation status through register and generates periodic activity (usage units)

For more information about Accelize IPs and Accelize Reference Design, please refer to [Accelize Website](http://www.accelize.com/) and [Accelize GitHub](https://github.com/Accelize)
